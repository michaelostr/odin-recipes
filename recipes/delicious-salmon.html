    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This salmon recipe is so easy, you won't believe how delicious it is! A simple marinade 
        made with soy sauce, brown sugar, and garlic adds so much flavor. It's quick to cook under 
        the broiler for a sensational salmon dinner.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon pepper</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pound skin-on salmon fillet</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk soy sauce, olive oil, brown sugar, lemon pepper, and garlic together in a shallow
            dish; lay salmon fillets skin-side up in the marinade; marinate in the refrigerator 4 
            to 8 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. 
            Transfer salmon fillets from marinade onto a baking sheet. Discard any remaining 
            marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook salmon under the broiler until lightly browned and the flesh flakes easily with a 
            fork, 7 to 10 minutes. Allow salmon to rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
